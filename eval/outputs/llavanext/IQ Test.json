Picture A: A circle with a dot inside.\n2. Picture B: A circle with a dot inside, but the dot is now on the outside of the circle.\n3. Picture C: A circle with a dot inside, but the dot is now on the outside of the circle, and the circle is now a square.\n4. Picture D: A circle with a dot inside, but the dot is now on the outside of the circle, and the circle is now a triangle.\n\nLooking at the pattern, we can see that the dot moves from the inside to the outside of the circle, and the shape of the circle changes from a circle to a square and then to a triangle. This suggests that the pattern is related to the shape of the circle and the position of the dot.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n(A) picture A\n(B) picture B\n(C) picture C\n(D) picture D\n\nThe correct answer is (C) picture C. The dot moves from the inside to the outside of the circle, and the circle changes from a circle to a square, which is consistent with the pattern established by the previous pictures.",
