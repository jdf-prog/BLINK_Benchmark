It is a realistic painting that captures the details of the woman's face and clothing.\n\nThe second image is a landscape painting of a rocky coastline with a blue sky. It is an impressionistic painting that captures the essence of the scene rather than the details.\n\nThe third image is a portrait of a woman with a yellow hat and a red flower. It is an expressionistic painting that uses bold colors and brushstrokes to convey emotion.\n\nBased on the analysis, the third image shares the same style as the reference image. Both paintings are realistic portraits that capture the details of the subjects. The answer is B.",
