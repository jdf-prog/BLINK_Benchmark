Look for patterns related to quantity or numbers that progress from one picture to the next.\n2. Check if there is a consistent way the images are rotated or flipped in sequence.\n3. Identify a common feature that each successive picture shares with the previous one, while also paying attention to any variations that might indicate a regular progression or change.\n\nNow, let's apply these rules to the given IQ test:\n\nPuzzle 1:\nPicture A: A square with a triangle inside it.\nPicture B: A square with a square inside it.\nPicture C: A square with a rectangle inside it.\nPicture D: A square with a circle inside it.\n\nThe common feature among these pictures is that they all contain a square.

Your task is to determine which of the four options can be folded from the existing picture.\n\nTo solve this IQ test, you will need to carefully examine the existing picture and the four options, and look for any similarities or differences between them. You will also need to use your spatial reasoning skills to imagine how the existing picture could be folded in different ways to create the options.\n\nOnce you have determined which option can be folded from the existing picture, you can write down your answer.
