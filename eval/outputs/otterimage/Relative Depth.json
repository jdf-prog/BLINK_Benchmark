A plane is made up of two points and a line through those points.\nThe image has a plane labeled on it. The plane has two points that are marked with a circle. For these two points, the circle shows the x-axis and the y-axis.\nWhen a camera looks at a plane, it takes a picture of the plane at that point. The camera also takes pictures at other points on the plane.\nSo, the camera can be used to take pictures at different points along the plane, and the points are called points A, B, C, and D in this image.",

BECAUSE: A point on an object is further away from an observer when the point is farther from the observer's camera.\nThe distance between a point on a object and a camera is called the object's projection distance. The smaller the projection distance is compared to the size of the object, the further away the point on the object is said to be.\nFor example, if you look at a small object in a museum, its points are farther away from the camera than if you looked at a large object.",
