Or, if there are two parts of an organism, such as a left and right ear, or a top and bottom heart, they can be described as corresponding to each other.\nThe process of identifying the corresponding points in two images is called a comparison.

It will tell you what to write about and what order to write it in.\nThis chain diagram has five circles and lines. Each circle represents a step in the chain. The lines connect each step to the one before and after it.\nTo use this chain diagram to help you write an essay, first choose a topic that has several aspects to it. For example, your topic could be the history of the city where you live. Next, read the topic you have chosen. Make notes about each aspect of the topic that you can think of. Then, look at the chain diagram. The first step in writing an essay is usually the introduction. So, write the introduction here, using the first circle as a guide. In your introduction, write about the first aspect that is shown in the circle. Be sure to tell the reader what this aspect is and how it relates to the topic as a whole. Use the lines to connect your introduction to the next circle. The second circle shows the next aspect in your topic. Write about this aspect in the second circle. Again, make sure the aspect is clear and related to the overall topic. Connect this aspect to the third circle with a line. Continue in this way, writing about the aspects in each circle and connecting them with lines. Make sure each aspect builds on the last one, leading the reader from general to specific information. Finally, write your conclusion. Connect your conclusion to the last circle, and make sure it wraps up all the main points in the essay. If you follow these steps, and if your essay has good flow and organization, you will have a successful essay.",
