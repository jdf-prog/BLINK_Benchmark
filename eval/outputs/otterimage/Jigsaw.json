A grid allows scientists to analyze and describe an image using mathematical terms.\nIf a grid has north, south, east, and west directions, those directions are called the coordinate system. The center of the grid is called the origin.\nIn an image, the pixels are often labeled with letters and numbers. For example, the top-left corner might be labeled as (A, 0).\nThe first image has a missing corner with the letters \"LL\".

What the image is about (the content).\n2. how the image looks (the structure and the edges).\n\nThe content of an image includes things like the scene, the people, and the objects.

These can include the edges, or boundaries, of the picture and the way the picture is put together.\nIn the example above, although there might not be a direct line between the content and the structure, the image helps you understand the scene and the people better because of the content.

An edge is the line that forms the boundary of an object or area in a picture.\n In the framed picture, for example, the edge of the frame forms a boundary between the picture and the surrounding air.

A blurry or poorly lit edge indicates a less-than-perfect photo or image processing. On the other hand, a well-defined edge shows that the image was captured and processed effectively.\n The edges of an image can give you clues about what the image is depicting.
