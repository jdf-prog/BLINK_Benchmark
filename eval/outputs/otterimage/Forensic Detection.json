For example, an image can show you a person's facial expression or their body language. These elements cannot be described in a sentence. Instead, the image allows you to see them.\nMany images with people in them are not real photographs. These are called stock photos.\nA stock photo is taken with real people, but they may be posing in a way that is different from how they would behave in a real situation, like a casual photo.

It is important to determine whether the photos are genuine or if they have been photoshopped or edited in some way.\nA real photograph will show the world as it is, without adding or taking away details.

Pictures can also be cost-effective. Consider the time you could save if you could just look at a picture instead of reading a long, wordy explanation.\nThe purpose of this image is to answer the question: \"Which of the following images is not a real photo?\". To do this, I must determine which image is different from the other three. A real photo should show a real person, object, or scene. It should be captured in nature or created by a person in a studio.\nIn contrast, all three of the other images are not real photos. They are likely images created in a photo shop, which use computer graphics or other artistic techniques.\nAn example of a non-real photo would be an image in which a person has been replaced with another person or an object has been added to the scene. Such an image would be classified as fake.",

Look at the background. Does the background look real (like a place you have seen before) or does it look like a painting (with colors that are not accurate for the places they are meant to represent)?\n2. Examine the details. Real pictures have details that may not be clear at first. Look for small details, like the color and texture of clothing, the details on a person's face, or the patterns on a floor.\n3. Check for anomalies. If something in the picture seems out of place or doesn't make sense, it might not be real. For example, if a person seems to have two different skin tones on their face, it could be a sign the picture is not real.\n4. Consider the lighting. Natural light and shadows can make a picture look more real. If the lighting in a picture seems too good to be true, it's possible that it's not a real image.\n5. Evaluate the composition. A well-composed picture has a balanced arrangement of elements, such as people, objects, and background. A picture with an unbalanced composition or odd angles might be a piece of art instead of a real one.\n6. Consider how the picture was taken. Real photos are taken with cameras, not drawn or painted.

However, a real-word description may not answer some questions you might have about an image.\nWhen you look at an image, see if it provides any clues that it is a picture rather than a painting or drawing.\nYou can use common sense to help you decide if a picture is real or not. For example, if you see something that moves when you move the picture, it is likely a real image, because it would be difficult to make that move by painting or coloring the picture.\nAnother way to check is to look for signs of highlights and shadows. Real objects have shadows on them, but the shadows may not be exactly square. Also, if an object is black, there should be a highlight showing that the black area is on top of another object.\nTests like these can help you determine how likely an image is real.\nIn the end, though, the decision will be up to you.",

A photograph of a scene with people in it will have people that are real, and the people will be interacting with their surroundings in a way that is possible in the real world. A realistic picture will show the people and the surroundings in more or less the same way that they would appear in a real-life situation.",

Look for elements of time, such as years or months, if possible. If the image is in black and white, it may indicate that it is an old photo.\nExamine the objects within the image. These objects will give you a clue as to what the scene is depicting. For example, if it's a car, there will likely be details like the make, model, and color to help identify the scene. Look at the people and animals, if any, to determine the setting and activity.\nFamiliarity with common objects can help you determine the time period of the photo.
