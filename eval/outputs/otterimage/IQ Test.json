However, for the purpose of measuring the area, we can divide the area into sections and give each section a number. We can then add up the numbers of these sections to determine the area of the entire circle.\nThis process of dividing the area and assigning numbers to the sections is called tiling.\nA tiled circle is a special type of tiling in which the circles that make up the tile are all the same size and have the same radius.",

BECAUSE: A graphic design is a type of visual art that involves the creation of images for various purposes, such as advertising, branding, or artistic expression.\nThe process of creating graphic designs involves specific techniques and tools, which can be more or less accessible depending on the skill level of the designer. Some common tools and techniques used in graphic design include drawing with paper and pencil, working with typefaces (the arrangement of text in a specific way), and using image editing software. The goal of a graphic designer is to create an image that communicates a specific idea or message effectively. This can be achieved through the use of color, shape, texture, and other design elements. In an art school graphic design course, students learn the fundamentals of design, typography, illustration, and digital media. They also study the principles of composition, balance, and contrast, which help them create visually appealing and effective designs.",

There are many different types of graphic designs, and they can be divided into categories based on the application or purpose of the design.\nThere are design elements and layout elements. Design elements are the visual components of a design, such as color, shape, size, line, texture, and contrast. A design may have multiple design elements, but each design element has a specific role in the overall design. A layout is the arrangement of design elements within a space.\nThe visual aspect of an interactive electronic book (IEB) is an example of a graphic design.

Each section of the graphic organizer shows a different aspect of your topic. Because there are different types of graphic organizers, each has its own title. For example, a table is called an array, and a chart is called a chart.\nAs you work on assignments, each student should use a different type of graphic organizer. Your teacher may have a preference, but it is important to be flexible and choose the type that best helps you show what you know.\nThe examples below show three different graphic organizers.

The colors, font sizes, and styles might also be considered part of the design. Each element in the site's design must be placed and arranged to create a cohesive, visually appealing layout while also guiding visitors to navigate the site and find the information they're looking for.

They may work on print materials, such as brochures and flyers, or on digital media, like websites and social media graphics. Their work is important, as it determines the look of a company, product, or event.\nThe design process for a graphic designer begins with an initial meeting with the client to discuss their needs. The designer then gathers information about the client's industry, target audience, and goals. This research helps the designer determine the best approach for the project. The next step is to create a concept, which is a rough draft of the design. The client reviews the concept and provides feedback. Based on this feedback, the designer makes changes to the concept until they reach a final version. The final design is then presented to the client for approval. Once the client gives their approval, the design is sent to a printer or other vendor for production. The graphic designer may also be involved in the production process, ensuring that the final product meets their high standards. In conclusion, a graphic design is a visual representation of an idea or message that is created with the purpose of conveying information or evoking an emotional response.",

Patterns are all around us. They appear in nature (pattern of petals on a flower), in architecture (the shape of windows in a building), and in art (a painting with a regular pattern of colors).\nMany people find patterns when they look closely at everyday objects, like the tiles on the roof of a building or the waves in the ocean.

The design includes elements such as logos, brochures, flyers, and advertisements, among many other items.\nThe design process typically involves several steps. First, the designer will meet with the client to determine the client's needs and preferences. The designer will also gather information about the target audience and the product or organization being designed. The next step is to brainstorm ideas and create rough drafts of the design. This process can involve sketching, doodling, or using design software. Once the designer has a rough draft, they will present it to the client, who will provide feedback and suggestions for improvements. The final draft is then created, and the design process is complete. In the past, graphic designers would use traditional methods, such as pencils, pens, and paper, to create their designs. However, with the advancements in technology, many graphic designers now use computer software to create and edit their work. This allows for a more efficient and precise design process, as well as the ability to experiment with different colors, shapes, and styles.

The design will usually be used for a specific purpose, such as a logo to represent a company, an advertisement to promote a product, or a brochure to inform people about an event.\nThe design process that graphic designers use is based on specific techniques and principles, which help to ensure that the finished product is visually appealing and effectively communicates the intended message. One of the fundamental principles of design is balance. Balance is the even distribution of visual weight within a composition. There are three types of balance: symmetrical, asymmetrical, and proportional. In a symmetrical balance, the visual weight is evenly distributed on both sides of a central point. This can be seen in the image on the left, which features two identical pictures that are mirror images of each other. In an asymmetrical balance, one side of the composition has more visual weight than the other. As shown in the picture on the right, one picture is larger and more prominent than the smaller one on the opposite side. Proportional balance refers to the distribution of size and shape within an image. For example, objects in a picture may be proportionally similar in size or shape, creating a sense of harmony and balance within the composition. In the image below, the two pictures on either side have different shapes and sizes, but the overall balance is maintained through the use of similar shapes and relative sizes. An important aspect of graphic design is the ability to create visual interest and draw the viewer's attention to specific areas or elements within a picture. This technique is called focalization, and it can be achieved by using contrast, color, shape, or texture to create a focal point or focal area within a design. In this image, the focal area is created by using a contrasting color and a unique shape to draw attention to the yellow circle in the middle of the picture. In summary, graphic design involves the creation of visually appealing images that effectively communicate a message or convey an idea. The principles of balance, symmetry, proportionality, and focalization are essential elements of successful graphic design.",

These labels can help you when you read, write, or discuss the topic.\nHow do graphic organizers help you. In the past, people who wanted to study or gather information about a subject often took notes by hand. These notes could be difficult for everyone in the room to see.

After reading a book or listening to a lecture on the Egyptians, you create a graphic organiser like the one below.\nThe graphic organizer helps you organize your thoughts about what you have read or heard. It also shows how the information about Egypt is related to other cultures like the Mesopotamians and the Greeks. Because this organization is visual, it is easier for you and anyone else who looks at your graphic organizer to find important information and to ask questions about it.
